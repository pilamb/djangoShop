# djangoShop


# Do not use it, still migrating from django 1.6.5 to 1.8/9.


A very simple shop where admins can upload products, manage users, events,
and a custom panel made for admins.

The frontend is done with HTML5, Bootstrap 3, css3, and some JS.
Support for users, orders, products, sales, messages, events, bill generation with pdf, sales treated with a Finite State Machine, using the google API to generate charts based on sales, costs, etc.
